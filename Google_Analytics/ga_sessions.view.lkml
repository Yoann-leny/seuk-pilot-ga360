# # Goals measure how well your site or app fulfills your target objectives. A goal represents a completed activity,
# # called a conversion, that contributes to the success of your business. Examples of goals include making a purchase
# # (for an ecommerce site), completing a game level (for a mobile gaming app), or submitting a contact information
# # form (for a marketing or lead generation site).

# # "Selected_goal_conversions", "selected_goal_conversion_rate", and "selected_goal_conversion_value" are the
# # measures used in the application interface. Make sure that these measures contain all of the possible goals.
